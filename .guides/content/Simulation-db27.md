Simulations can help us learn about natural phenomena that would normally develop over a long time in a much shorter time frame.  The cycle of predators and prey is an example where if a system becomes imbalanced, the predators may eat all of the available food and in-turn starve.  These understandings would be difficult to achieve in a wild setting and could have moral implications for researchers trying to understand the system.
