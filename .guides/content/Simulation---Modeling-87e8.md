Many everyday activities are too complex and too interdependent to be broken down to a simple equation.  For example, road traffic cannot be broken down to simple equations wherein all cars travel at the same speed, behave in a predictable manner, etc.  

To learn how to best design these systems, simulations are run.  Simulations can help scientists and engineers understand the unpredictable ways that a system may act.  This data would be very difficult to get in a natural way.
