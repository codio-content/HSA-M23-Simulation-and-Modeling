Looking back at the dice game we made earlier, we would like to create a simulation based on the roll of the dice.

## Predators vs. Prey
During each simulation round, the following simulation occurs
A predator will either catch prey or go hungry.
The prey, if not eaten, will increase in population
Each of these events will be based on probabilities and the roll of the dice.

A predator eats if the dice is 4 or higher
Prey increase their numbers if the roll is 5 or higher
